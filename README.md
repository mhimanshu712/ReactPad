## JokesApp :joy:
This was a code-along project built form scratch.<br>
It fetches jokes from an API (https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) and saves them locally.<br>
You can upvote or downvote the jokes and it arranges them accordingly.

## LightsOut Game :joystick:
This was a code-along project built from scratch.<br>
This was more of a CSS project, had to work on a lot of animations and effects.<br>
This is a recreation of the Lights Out electronic game released by Tiger Electronics back in 90s.

## ToDoList :spiral_notepad:
This was an exercise given.<br>
The UI has been taken from a CodePen, I hooked it up to the react.<br>
All the data is stored locally.

## Vending Machine :slot_machine:
This was just a silly exercise project, revolving around React Router.<br>
You can get a few items from the Vending Machine, and way it gives it to you is a little amusing.
